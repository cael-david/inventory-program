Inventory Management System
This project is a complete inventory management system developed over the course of 1.5 months. It efficiently organizes items and address mappings, with the additional feature of exporting data to Excel-readable tables.

About the Project
The main challenge in building this system was working with new tools and methods for the first time. Throughout the development process, the code underwent several structural changes and iterations. Building this project entirely on my own was a real challenge, but also a valuable learning experience.

Although I used AI tools to help create and adapt some methods, the core logic and system design were fully my own.

Development Process
The first stage of development didnâ€™t involve any coding. I started by carefully planning the steps and logic that the system would follow. This planning phase lasted about five days, during which I defined the core structure, methods, and flow of the program.

After the planning phase, I moved on to intensive development, always focusing on improving performance, structure, and user experience.

Features
Organized and efficient item/address mapping

Export functionality to Excel-readable table formats

Clean and intuitive interface

Modular and maintainable codebase

Future Updates
Further improvements and features are expected in the future, including UI enhancements and extended data management options.
